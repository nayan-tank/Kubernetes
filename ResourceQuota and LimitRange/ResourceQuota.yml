# ResourceQuota is for limiting the total resource consumption of a namespace, for example:

# Object Based Quota
apiVersion: v1
kind: ResourceQuota
metadata:
  name: myquota
  labels:
    type: object-based-quota
spec:
  hard:
    pods: 2 # only two pods can exists in defined namespace
    configmaps: 2
    replicationcontrollers: 2
    services: 2

---
# Compute Based Quota
apiVersion: v1
kind: ResourceQuota
metadata:
  name: myquota2
  labels:
    type: compute-based-quota
spec:
  hard:
    requests.cpu: "200M" 
    requests.memory: "200Mi" # or 0.2
    limits.cpu: "100M" 
    limits.memory: "100Mi" # or 0.1
    

    # Keep in mind this three things
      # 1. if you specify request and limit than it'll use accordingly
      # 2. if you specify limit but not request then request will be equal to limit
      # 3. if you specify request and not limit then limit will be equal to default limit of the Kubernetes cluster. 
      #  This default limit should be determined by the Kubernetes administrator
